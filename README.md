# Portfolio

This piece of work focuses on building the structure of my portfolio, focussing on the HTML and CSS parts, and deploying it to Github pages.

## Why a Portfolio

A portfolio is an important tool which can be very helpful when looking for work as a web developer. This is a great platform to showcase the different projects worked on and give access to the code to recruiters so they can have a feel of the person's coding style.
This can also help developers looking to set themselves up as freelance developers. Their potential clients can visit this page and have a feel of the styles and functionalities that the person can build for them.

## Development steps

The general steps that I followed to develop this templates are listed below:

- wireframe design
- skeleton html with div as per the wireframe + css flexbox for page structure
- css on the different containers for a responsive page: for mobile and for desktop (with media query)
- additional css for improved layout and interaction

## Technologies

Some of the key technologies used here are:

- HTML: semantic elements, links, google fonts, fontawesome
- CSS: flexbox, media query, pseudo classes, root variables
- GIT: Github repo, deployed github pages

## The wireframe design

Recap of the sections envisaged
Differences between mobile and desktop views

## The HTML skeleton

Views of the structure and its link to the wireframe
Use of semantic elements

## CSS styling for page structure

Use of flex containers - flex property set on container class
double assignment of classes
Grouping of some classes for CSS properties

## CSS styling for responsiveness of the page

Use of media query for a responsive page:

- media query for phone screen under a width of 596px
- media query for phone screen under a width of 300px

## CSS styling for an improved interaction

Use of pseudo-classes for added effect on the page:

- on hover over the project cards
- on hover over the links (nav links, project links, contact links)

## Upcoming features

Additional features to develop at the next update with the use of javascript:

- Language choice
- Filter options in project display

## Screenshots of desktop view and mobile view
